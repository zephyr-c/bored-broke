<!-- inside loop, access event_id or event_uri, which will uniquely pull just the json for that event.
use this to get data necessary to save to table.
look into adding to DB from json? not sure I understand completely but there's probably someting in react cards.
 add some sort of click listener to save elements, send post?-->
