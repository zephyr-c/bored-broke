Moving from one music scene to another can be a daunting task for any musical act, but Mint has found their footing in San Francisco. Since moving, they have found a consistent rotation of shows in the area, including the Noise Pop 20th Street Block Party and a Music City showcase at Hemlock Tavern in July 2018. We were fortunate to find these \u201cSurfy Rocky Reverby Garagy Rock\u201d-ers rehearsing in our studios, and are excited to watch their continued growth. The Fluorescents: From the deep depths of an obscure Craigslist post in 2017, the luminous group called The Fluorescents was formed. Hailing from all parts of the United States and Kingdom, and brought together by a love of Courtney Barnett, The Beatles, Mac DeMarco, and Twin Peaks, they\u2019ve assembled a lineup made up of mostly indie, sometimes garage-y, less-so-folky songs. The guys (vocalist/guitarist Jared Rosen, drummer James Clubbe, bassist Spencer Riewerts and guitarist/vocalist Stef Montali) are here to play some tunes and hope to see you soon. Rudy Colombini Band: Music City Founder, Rudy Colombini, was born and raised in the North Beach area of the rich cultural mix of San Francisco. This artistic center spawned the poetry, novels, and jazz of the Beat Generation and has been a breeding ground for bands in the vanguard of all styles of music for decades. His career has been diverse and eclectic. He has realized Top 40 Triple A Radio success with the band I Am and the Colombini penned tracks, Under The Impression and She's Invincible. 2012 saw Rudy return to the recording studio and now we have the release of a remarkable EP, The Perfect Gift, and it's perfectly timed offering for Triple-A Radio, Summertime. Rolling Stone photographer Robert Altman, who is familiar with the scope of Colombini's work, says of Summertime, \"That's beautiful music\u2026 I think I like it best of all\u201d. \u201cI have to be true to myself, who I am, and where I\u2019ve been,\u201d says Rudy. \u201dThe music I make is the product of the music I love and the things in life that I think are important. I\u2019ve been lucky, and my plan is to make music for the rest of my life\u201d.Thank You Come Again: A four-piece rock/grunge band that infuses melodic vocals with murderous guitar riffs. While songwriters Danny Lomeli and Izzie Clark come from very different sonic backgrounds, they come together to create a sound they hope no one has heard before. The band began in October 2018, and since then they\u2019ve played numerous shows around California, released a four-song EP, and currently have big plans for a full-length album and tour.The Fixins: The Fixins are a Bay Area-based Americana jam band that plays an original and eclectic mix of folk, funk, roots, and blues music. Their unique sound blends heartfelt and substantive songwriting with funky, boot-stompin\u2019 party grooves. The Fixins large arsenal of well-crafted original songs relies heavily on dynamics, poetic lyricism, and beautifully layered instrumentation. Singers w/ Larkin Street Youth Services:Yung Figga & Law - Hector AKA Yung Figga was born in El Salvador. He does not label himself to be one type of genre as he has been influenced by many different artists around the world. One of his biggest influences is Tupac Shakur. Hector believes that music can impact lives by having a positive message in a song, that it can create unity, uplift souls by connecting to the people\u2019s struggles.

Moving from one music scene to another can be a daunting task for any musical act, but Mint has found their footing in San Francisco. Since moving, they have found a consistent rotation of shows in the area, including the Noise Pop 20th Street Block Party and a Music City showcase at Hemlock Tavern in July 2018. We were fortunate to find these \u201cSurfy Rocky Reverby Garagy Rock\u201d-ers rehearsing in our studios, and are excited to watch their continued growth.<BR> <BR>The Fluorescents: From the deep depths of an obscure Craigslist post in 2017, the luminous group called The Fluorescents was formed.

Rolling Stone photographer Robert Altman, who is familiar with the scope of Colombini's work, says of Summertime, \"That's beautiful music\u2026 I think I like it best of all\u201d. \u201cI have to be true to myself, who I am, and where I\u2019ve been,\u201d says Rudy. \u201dThe music I make is the product of the music I love and the things in life that I think are important.
