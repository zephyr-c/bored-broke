In addition to this lifelong skill, you will leave with your handmade jar, a bag of McVicker Pickles\u2019 special spice blend, and a list of recipes and resources for your future pickling endeavors.<BR><BR><B>Class Overview &amp; What's Included:</B><BR><BR>-Welcome with a tasting of assorted pickles<BR>-Overview of ingredients, supplies and techniques<BR>-Step-by-step recipe instruction on fermentation and vinegar pickling (veggies vary by season)<BR>-Secrets for making crunchy, tangy pickles every time<BR>-Step-by-step instructions on home canning<BR>-What equipment you need, and what you can do without<BR>-Where to go for fresh, affordable produce and spices<BR>-How to ensure that you're preserving your food safely<BR>-Includes all jars, spices, materials and farmers market fresh produce<BR>-Each participant leaves with a jar of vinegar pickles and a container of fermented goodies! (sauerkraut or kimchi)<BR><BR><B>Participant Reviews:</B><BR><BR>\"Kelly is super knowledgeable and very warm. An SF treasure, really. Her class will pique your interest in creating your own pickles. I'm certainly not a cook, but I learned enough to get started and have some good ideas about ingredients, and what I would like to pickle.\" --Bill B., San Francisco<BR><BR>\"Kelly was so wonderful and so was her class! We organized this with a bunch of friends. We played music, learned to pickle and had a great time! I definitely recommend this!!!\" --Shanna T., San Francisco</P><P><IMG SRC=\"https://d2ga8dje9bus38.cloudfront.net/vLTg9z0QGOfUVujn96Ai_verlocal_beverages_fermentation_&_preservation_class_workshop_in_san_francisco.jpg\"></IMG></P><P><IMG SRC=\"https://d2ga8dje9bus38.cloudfront.net/t9BRScT1QXeCtIsPNRHY_verlocal_beverages_fermentation_&_preservation_class_workshop_in_san_francisco.jpg\"></IMG></P><P><IMG SRC=\"https://d2ga8dje9bus38.cloudfront.net/TqFtbB4FR36XapTqMrWM_verlocal_beverages_fermentation_&_preservation_class_workshop_in_san_francisco.jpg\"></IMG></P><P><IMG SRC=\"https://d2ga8dje9bus38.cloudfront.net/tOEuJIaTWGIeq121xy9T_verlocal_beverages_fermentation_&_preservation_class_workshop_in_san_francisco.jpg\"></IMG></P><P><IMG SRC=\"https://d2ga8dje9bus38.cloudfront.net/InpDPxBdT2i8UzOLlA0y_verlocal_beverages_fermentation_&_preservation_class_workshop_in_san_francisco.jpg\"></IMG></P><P><IMG SRC=\"https://d2ga8dje9bus38.cloudfront.net/VvqA87drTyKf2voZC1O5_verlocal_beverages_fermentation_&_preservation_class_workshop_in_san_francisco.jpg\"></IMG></P><P><IMG SRC=\"https://d2ga8dje9bus38.cloudfront.net/iAqfJ6wASU6Kd5gw9rRD_verlocal_beverages_fermentation_&_preservation_class_workshop_in_san_francisco.jpg\"></IMG></P><P><IMG SRC=\"https://d2ga8dje9bus38.cloudfront.net/ZoBydZKRSbeSnk1YKczq_verlocal_beverages_fermentation_&_preservation_class_workshop_in_san_francisco.jpg\"></IMG></P><BR><DIV> #byob #datenight #diy #food #funtimes #how to pickle #learn #mcvicker #mcvicker pickles #pickles #pickling #pickling pickles</DIV><BR><BR><I>By completing this booking request, you acknowledge that this is a request that needs to be confirmed by our Partners.

Please register before attending.\n* * What is Scratch? * *\u00a0\nScratch is a free programming environment from MIT especially design for kids. It runs in your browser: just go to https://scratch.mit.edu. (While Scratch runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, it requires Flash, so it will not run on phones or tablets.)\nBy snapping together code blocks, kids can make games, cartoons, or science simulations. This design makes Scratch a great choice for learning how to program.\n\n* * Do we need programming or math experience for the workshop? * *\u00a0\nNo experience is required. In each workshop we go through, step by step, making a simple video game project. We work on a different project every Saturday, so your child can drop in as often as they're available.\nIt's a common misconception that programming requires being good at math. Your child will only need to be familiar with addition, subtraction, and possibly multiplication and division. Being familiar with Cartesian coordinates (X and Y coordinates) is helpful but not required.\n\n* * What is the age range for the class? * *\u00a0\nThe minimum age is 9. Participants are usually between 10 and 15.\n\n* * Can I sit with my child during the workshop? * *\u00a0\nYes, if there is room. If your child is younger or might not have the confidence to attend on their own, you can sit next to them and follow along with the projects yourself. You can learn at the workshop and help them at home. Parents are also welcome to wait in the lobby outside the classroom and use the museum's WiFi. If the class is crowded, kids will get priority for classroom seats over parents.\n\n* * Where can I park? * *\u00a0\nThere is metered parking on Broadway (in front of the museum) and Piedmont (in the back). Street parking is free on Sundays.\n\n* * Should I sign up for a Scratch account? * *\u00a0\nYou can, but it is not required. It is free to sign up on the https://scratch.mit.edu site. It only requires an email address. Signing up for an account makes it easy for your child to continue working on their projects at home after the workshop.\n\n* * Do I need to bring a laptop? * *\u00a0\nNo, we have computers for students to use. But bringing your own computer would let your child easily continue working on their projects at home.\n\n* * How can I download my child's games on our home computer? * *\u00a0\nAt the end of each workshop, if students don't have a Scratch account they can save to the MADE's Scratch account. All projects will be available shortly after each workshop at this web site:\nhttps://scratch.mit.edu/users/MadeUpload/\nUnder the \"Shared Projects\" area, find your child's project and click on it.
