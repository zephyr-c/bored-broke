Now in its fifth printing and 18 languages, it is currently in development as a musical. Dreidels on the Brain (Dial Books, 2016) is, as you might have guessed, a Kchannukkah title. In fact, it's a fictionalized-coming-of-age Hanukkah memoir which received Sydney Taylor honors, was chosen as a finalist for the National Jewish Book award, and holds the world record for the most ways to spell Khaanukkaah. Both Joel's books and CDs will be available at Ashkenaz. In addition to his storytelling, books and CDs, Joel is one of the nation's leading story consultants.\nWhile the stories Joel tells come from all over the world, his favorite to tell are the Jewish folktales he'll be sharing with us at Ashkenaz, here in his home town of Berkeley.
